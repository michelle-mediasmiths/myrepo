#
# The file pick up implementation can be configured to work in active/passive or just active mode
# In active/passive mode a heartbeat message must be supplied periodically to the agent
# If the agent does not get an activation, or it is stale (suupplied outside of a time window) then the pick up will not occur
#
# the time in milliseconds that a file must not change before pick up will occur
